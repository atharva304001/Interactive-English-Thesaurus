What Is a Thesaurus?

A thesaurus is a reference book used to find different words that have the same or similar meanings.

According to The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, the word "thesaurus" comes from the Latin word "thesaurus" which comes from the Greek word "thesauros," both of which mean a treasury or storehouse. This literal translation is fitting since most people consider a thesaurus to be a large collection of words which can be searched to find the perfect one.

A similar word, "thesaurarie," referring to early dictionaries and collections of words, was used in the late 16th century in England. In fact, the earliest thesauri, the plural form of thesaurus, were like dictionaries. Oftentimes, these dictionaries used lots of synonyms to help explain what a word meant. Thomas Cooper's Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae from 1565 used synonyms to help explain words, particularly words with Latin origins. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary was published in 1755, but this collection of words was clearly not a thesaurus. Nearly a century later in 1852, Peter Mark Roget created the thesaurus people are familiar with today. Roget was a physician and teacher fascinated with words who collected his treasury of words just for fun.
